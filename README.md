# GradeBoost
### Problem 
When it comes to assignments, most students want to get the best grades possible. One way of doing so, especially after the assignment is graded, is to make an appeal for their grade to their professors. Traditionally, this process has been done via email. However, this method led to problems on both the students’ and the professors’ end. While the the appeals were scattered everywhere and cluttered up professors’ inboxes, students’ appeals were prone to be overlooked, leading to a delay in trying to improve their grades. 
### Description
To address the frustration that can arise on both ends, we hope to produce GradeBoost, an web application providing a centralized and streamlined solution facilitating the submission, tracking, and resolution of grade appeals. Through the user-friendly interface, students will be able to view their courses and submit assignment-specific grade appeals. In addition, they will be able to track the the progress of their appeals, receive updates, and communicate with the professor through a discussion thread.
Professors are able to view all their students’ appeals in a centralized dashboard. They may respond, reassign the appeal, forward appeals to graders, and use pre-written templates to help them respond to the appeal. With the development of GradeBoost, we aim to ease the process of appealing and modifying grades for students and professors of Calvin University.
